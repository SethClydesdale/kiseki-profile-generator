# Kiseki Profile Generator
Kiseki Profile Generator is a website that lets you create your own Trails series profile which you can share with others on X via the [#TrailsProfile](https://x.com/search?q=%23TrailsProfile&src=typed_query&f=live) or [#軌跡プロフィール](https://x.com/search?q=%23%E8%BB%8C%E8%B7%A1%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB&src=typed_query&f=live) hashtags. It's a way to meet other fans of the series by sharing what games you've played, your favorite characters, etc. You can give it a try online via the following link!
